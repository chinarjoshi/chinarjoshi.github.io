  Hey there! My name is Chinar Joshi and I'm a software engineer with big hopes for the future of Linux.

I often bite off more than I can chew in terms of projects, so please consider contributing any way you can!
This includes data collection, testing, documentation writing, and ideation.

There are currently two scripts for data collection I need help with. Instructions can be found at the following pages:

* [Brilliant](http://neuralinux.com/brilliant)
* [Persist](http://neuralinux.com/persist)

If you have any questions or ideas, please contact me at chinarjoshi7@gmail.com. Thank you for reading!
