title: A (Modern) Tale Of Two Editors
permalink: /tale-of-two-editors/

In the annals of programmer folklore, few debates have been as fervent, as enduring, or as inconclusive as Vim vs. Emacs. These two text editors have not only carved out distinct philosophies but also nurtured zealous communities. Yet, as time rolls on and technology advances, are Vim and Emacs being left in the dust by more modern editors, or are they evolving to continue their relevance?

## NeoVim: The Speedster's Refuge

NeoVim, an aggressively refactored fork of Vim, is the darling of the minimalists and the impatient. It aimed to improve upon Vim by making it more extensible, more communal, and more responsive. Features like built-in terminal emulation and an advanced plugin API have made it a powerful tool, transcending its roots as just a text editor. However, despite its modern attributes, NeoVim primarily attracts a diminishing niche of Linux enthusiasts who prioritize speed and resource efficiency above all else, including yours truly.

## Modern Emacs Frameworks: The Struggle to Adapt

Emacs is a giant, not just in terms of its feature set but also its codebase. With a core written in C and extensions primarily in Emacs Lisp, this granddaddy of text editors is as powerful as it is complex. However, this complexity is double-edged. The Emacs core is a maze of intricate C code, understood fully by only a select few who can maintain it. Frameworks like Doom Emacs try to ameliorate this by providing a curated, efficient experience. Doom, for instance, provides Vim-style modal editing within Emacs while focusing on performance optimization like lazy loading.

## The AI Revolution: ChatGPT's Profound Impact

ChatGPT was not just another step forward; it was an irreversable leap that instantly shifted the global paradigm for text-based interaction. As conversational AI, it could understand context, respond to queries, and even write code snippets. But the key differentiator is that it fundamentally changed the way we code. Now, instead of merely relying on the text editor's built-in features, you interact with an AI that understands your code, helps debug it, and can even propose architectural improvements. The edge will go to those developers who can best adapt to and leverage these AI tools.

Here lies the crux: Will Vim and Emacs integrate these AI advancements to remain relevant, or will they become the typewriters of the coding world? Given their static nature and steep learning curves, I'm skeptical. While it's conceivable that community-driven plugins could bring some form of AI interaction to these editors, the chances of them natively incorporating such advanced functionalities seem slim.

## Conclusion

The Vim vs. Emacs debate is a relic but also an enduring testament to deeply-rooted philosophies about the tools we use to shape our digital worlds. However, as artificial intelligence integrates ever more closely with our daily coding lives, static features and speed may become secondary to the capacity for intelligent interaction. Therefore, it is not just a question of whether Vim and Emacs can survive, but whether they can evolve to encapsulate this new paradigm of intelligent coding.

### Food for thought:

As ChatGPT and other conversational AI tools become more integrated into our development environments, how will this redefine what it means to be a "skilled" programmer? Will mastery over a text editor be overshadowed by the ability to effectively collaborate with AI, turning the coding process into a dialogue with a machine rather than a monologue with a keyboard?
