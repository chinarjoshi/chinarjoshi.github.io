No one likes spending time on ansillary tasks in software development because the specifics constantly change in early stages of the project. The result is lack of accurate documentation throughout the life of a program, and inconsistent environments because of the lack of code infrastructure. 
Its certainly less exciting to do the administrative housekeeping rather than designing the important algorithms.
