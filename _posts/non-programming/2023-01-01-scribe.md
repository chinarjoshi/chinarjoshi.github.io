Music is neglected by programmers. I don't mean just listening, but fully engaging and creating it. In fact, most STEM students who played an instrument during high school drop it before graduation because of increased workload and stress. And that's a justifiable statistic, but melody comes natural to all humans in some way. The problem is that creating melody is locked behind complex music theory and composition software, and the only incentive to learn it is purely personal. I know this categorization may be a stretch, but music is *literally* non-programming.

I know it's a stretch to put this idea under this category, but music is *technically* non-programming.
Scribe is a transformer that takes a segment of a song on YouTube and generates sheet music for any desired instrumentation.
The model is trained on YouTube song - MuseScore sheet music pairs. The syncronization is achieved using techniques from ___ paper.
Music arrangement is gated behind complex theory and software

Transcribing my favorite songs for trombone is a daunting task. I don't have the skills to play songs by ear, and I don't have much experience writing
music with proper music writing software, like MuseScore.

I want to be able to take any song and just have sheet music ready for any instrumentation (in my case, a trombone choir). Writing the sheet music takes a lot of music theory that I want to learn eventually but don't have the time to do now. I would rather enjoy playing my instrument instead of learning how to use another monolithic software to enable me to do so.
