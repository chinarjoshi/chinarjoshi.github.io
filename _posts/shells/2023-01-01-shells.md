The UNIX command-line was clearly designed by the hardened programmers fabled in [The Night Watch](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf), who worked with rudimentary tools like pointy sticks and teletypewriters. They laid the groundwork of their OS with their bare hands and wrote textbooks when things went wrong. However, today's command-line users get to wear their non-functional scarfs and sip tea while executing `./run.sh` because of the hard work of those systems programmers before us. But boy did they leave us some unresolved baggage while designing these systems.

Unix shells have the worst out-of-box user experience I've ever used, rivaled only by that of the original `ed` line editor and my school's class registration portal. They are enigmatic and dumb programs that work the way I imagine Patrick from SpongeBob thinks. Your command didn't seem to do what you expected? Well then you'd better cross your fingers it didn't have any side effects, or else you'll be scratching your head pondering what happened to your disk image went after executing `sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=archlinux.iso`.

Though shells are extremely pragmatic and efficient, they are interactive tools designed for humans at the end of the day. Why don't we take a look at the evolution of UX features in influential shells?
1. Multics shell, 1967
		 This was the OG command-line interpreter distributed with the Multics operating system. It started as the primitive program RUNCOM that executed commands in a script back to back (the "rc" from ".bashrc" is a remnant of this program) The subsequent "shell" started the idea of using "commands somehow like a programming language."
1. Thompson shell, sh, 1971
		 Modeled after Multics shell and was distributed with UNIX 1-6. It introduced piping (`ls | grep 'txt'`), wildcards (`ls *.c`), and conditionals.
  1. Bourne shell, sh, 1977
		   Another Bell Labs shell which was distributed with UNIX 7. It introduced more of the basic features common to all Unix shells, like functions (`x() { echo x }`), asynchronous execution of commands (`sleep 5 &`), and a fresh environment for every subprocess.
1. C shell, csh, 1978
		  At last, a shell with thought put into its interactive usage. It supports everything from Thompson shell + history, command substitution (`echo $(date)`), aliases (`alias l='ls -al`), here documents (`cat << EOF`), condition testing (`[[ -z $(ls) ]]`), named variables (`a=b`), and iteration.
  1. Bourne again shell, bash, 1989
		  The first open source shell made for the GNU project with all the features before it. Later versions added Perl-style regex and associative arrays. 
1.  Z shell, zsh, 1990
	    Open source, based on C shell, and introduced extended globbing (`ls **/*.c`), spell check, and a whole lot more customizability.
1.  Fish shell, fish, 2005
		 Basically, a fully configured zsh with autosuggestions and syntax highlighting out of the box. Not widely adopted due to slow performance in scripting tasks.

My point with all of this is that popular shells have not since the C shell in 1978. <small>(Note: I read on IBM's website that shells are like editors where everyone has a favorite and tells you why you should switch. Except here the options aren't reach for the escape key or have carpal tunnel syndrome, its have an easy time installing plugins or a less easy time installing plugins)</small>.

Now, I already hear those of you with grey beards that touch the ground thinking "this gen-Z kid does an awful lot of complaining, the shell never treats me wrong." But just like I would say to someone who defends Subway because its old and reliable, *it doesn't have to be this way*. The truth is that an increasing number of CS students are being exposed to the shell and are freaking out because they have to learning a foreign language, one which has a vocabulary containing "chmod" and "lsmod" which sound similar but have absolutely nothing in common, one where they learn not from Duolingo but rather `man` pages where the key bindings of the pager are derived from a 1976 text editor (vi).
For software with a healthily growing user base, this is an unacceptable standard of living.

Take the default zsh prompt vs zsh with the [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. In the former, all I've learned for free is that my name is Chinar... great.

In the latter, I get my current working directory, return status of the previous command (green vs red arrow) and whether I'm in a git repository, and what branch and repo status in case it is.

The difference in the mental overhead of this small component is baffling. Surely, no sane person uses the default shell theme for more than a one-off ssh session (hopefully), but that requires users to either blindly copy and paste enigmatic incantations that for some reason hate spaces, or take the time to learn shell scripting. In the latter case, many hairs will grey to the realization that [dereferencing a pointer](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/ivr.html) `var` in bash is `${!var}` which makes sense, but in zsh it's `echo \$$var`. sigh... I suppose our shell scripts can't have nice things that were invented after Stephan Bourne.

In an ideal world, our computers would understand our English directly, and require minimal interaction to achieve whatever task we sought to do. The latter can be readily achieved with built-in shell primitives like the alias. And now that LLMs are extremely widespread, the former seems begging to be solved as well. I think the combination of the two would radically improve the users experience in all existing shells, with no fancy DSL or extensive configuration required.

Now, I don't need to write about the countless quirks of Unix programs; there's a whole [book about it](https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf). Despite some inscrutable design choices, I love the Unix philosophy and ecosystem. The fact it is pervasive to this day is sufficient proof it did something right. But for the unacquainted bunch, learning "the terminal" is an unnecessary source of anxiety, pushing them to the tantalizing evils of Microsoft and Google. If a few people from the containerization bunch or Red Hat rack their brains on what the average command-line user wanted while still being practical as a default, I'm sure we would have shells that are more friendly and forgiving than Ebenezer Scrooge.
