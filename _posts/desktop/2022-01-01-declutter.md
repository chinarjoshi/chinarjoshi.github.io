*Dirty Rotten Cleaners* follows a team of expert cleaners tidying the most cluttered, messiest houses you've ever seen. But they would probably pursue a career change after seeing your *Downloads* folder. It is only natural that we horde everything we come across for the distant day we might need it, and only do spring cleaning when we feel shameful enough to tidy up.
