*Dirty Rotten Cleaners* follows a team of expert cleaners tidying the most cluttered, messiest houses you've ever seen. But they would probably pursue a career change after seeing your *Downloads* folder. It is only natural that we horde everything we come across for the distant day we might need it, and only do spring cleaning when we feel shameful enough to tidy up. But fear not the digital debris of *"Final resume (1) (1) (2).pdf"* or *"Screenshot 2024-01-15 162912.png"*, because we can let AI do the cleaning for us.

Underutilized feature: archives and inotify
