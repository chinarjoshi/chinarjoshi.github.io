Life happens in the browser. For better or worse, user space has evolved past the neolithic era of files and native applications in exchange for cloud storage and web apps. They may have poor memory usage and performance, but at least we don't have to install a melange of bloated apps that rot away on our disks and add to our cognitive load. 

But the browser people are hiding something from you underneath their bullish marketing: we can never fully get rid of native apps. Some tasks must be achievable offline, or with low latency, or through the command-line. For those of you who would not be content with a Chromebook, there is a very noticible seam when transitioning between web and native. There are seperate ecosystems and interfaces. There is cloud storage, and then there are file systems. There are tab groups, and then there are workspaces. There is no glue integrating the two world together, until now...

There are two interfaces:
 * Browser:
 * System tray
