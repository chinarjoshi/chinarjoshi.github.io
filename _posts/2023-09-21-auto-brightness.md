title: AI-Enhanced Adaptive Screen Brightness
---
Screen brightness management may seem like a trivial issue, but it significantly impacts user experience in terms of eye strain and battery longevity. Existing solutions like Windows' Adaptive Brightness and macOS' True Tone offer basic capabilities, yet they lack the finesse and adaptability provided by neural networks. On the Linux front, tools like wluma offer not only ambient light-based adjustments but also consider on-screen content. However, they do not account for factors like time of day, leaving room for a more comprehensive solution. This article delves into the technical architecture of a neural network-based approach to screen brightness adjustment on Linux, covering Xorg and Wayland.
The Need for AI-Enhanced Adaptive Brightness

Traditional sensor-based systems and heuristic algorithms like those in wluma merely respond to changes in ambient light and screen content. Adding a neural network into the mix allows us to incorporate more complex variables like time of day and user behavior. This can result in a far more nuanced brightness adjustment algorithm, thus enhancing user experience in terms of visual comfort and battery optimization.
System Architecture
Data Sources

* Ambient Light Sensor (ALS): Real-time lighting conditions.
* Screen Capture: Snapshot to calculate screen content brightness and color balance.
* System Clock: To factor in the time of day.

## Neural Network Model

A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained on ALS data, current screen brightness, screen content features (average brightness, contrast, dominant color), and time-of-day to predict the optimal brightness level.
Backend Implementation

* Xorg: Utilizing xbacklight or manipulation of /sys/class/backlight/*/brightness.
        Daemon: Listens for ALS changes, screen content updates, and time-of-day changes.
        Inference Engine: Runs the neural network model for optimal brightness.
        Adjustment Module: Executes the brightness change using xbacklight or by editing sysfs entries.
* Wayland: Utilizing D-Bus calls to interface with the compositor for brightness changes.
        Compositor Plugin: Embedded into the Wayland compositor.
        Inference Engine and Adjustment Module: Integrated within the compositor plugin.

## Flow

* Data Gathering: ALS, screen capture, and time-of-day data are collected.
* Preprocessing: ALS data is normalized; screen content features like brightness and color balance are extracted; time-of-day is formatted appropriately.
* Inference: The neural network model predicts the optimal screen brightness.
* Adjustment: Brightness is adjusted through either xbacklight (Xorg) or D-Bus calls to the compositor (Wayland).

## Conclusion

While existing tools like wluma offer advanced brightness adjustment based on both ambient light and screen content, the incorporation of neural networks enables more nuanced, user-specific adjustments that consider a variety of factors including the time of day. The outlined architecture and flow can be a scalable solution for Linux environments, compatible with both Xorg and Wayland, filling a gap in a space that calls for intelligent automation.
Thought-Provoking Idea:

Could leveraging AI in such a granular aspect of user experience be overkill, or is it the inevitable future where even the simplest adjustments are AI-driven? What are the computational costs of running such a system in the background, and could they offset the benefits in battery life?
