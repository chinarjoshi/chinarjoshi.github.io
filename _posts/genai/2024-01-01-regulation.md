Aspiring programmers seem to perceive programming like a playing the guitar to serenade your love at first sight, in that they think of a fun song, immediately start writing, and play it. But in reality, its a concert. You have to collaborate with other musicians, secure a venue and setting (*devops*), convince people to come (*marketing*) and tell them how to get there (*documentation*), and hold dress rehearsals (*testing*). Otherwise, you're just a bum playing your trombone in the streets with no one listening, except for the disgruntled apartment residents above you that are the source of the tomatoes.

Fallibilism asserts that all beliefs are subject to doubt and should be continually tested against new evidence. In the context of digital news:

    Contextual Skepticism: Encourage readers to adopt a fallibilist approach by questioning the certainty of the information presented in news articles. Highlight the importance of seeking out context and corroborating evidence to assess the reliability of news.
    Continuous Revision: Discuss how ongoing events and stories often evolve, and initial reports might be revised or corrected as new information emerges. This underscores the fallibilist notion that our understanding is always provisional.
