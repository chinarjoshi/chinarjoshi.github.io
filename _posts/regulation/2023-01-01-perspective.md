scaling and selection
Scribe is a transformer that takes a segment of a song on YouTube and generates sheet music for any desired instrumentation.
The model is trained on YouTube song - MuseScore sheet music pairs. The syncronization is achieved using techniques from ___ paper.
Music arrangement is gated behind complex theory and software

Transcribing my favorite songs for trombone is a daunting task. I don't have the skills to play songs by ear, and I don't have much experience writing
music with proper music writing software, like MuseScore.

I want to be able to take any song and just have sheet music ready for any instrumentation (in my case, a trombone choir). Writing the sheet music takes a lot of music theory that I want to learn eventually but don't have the time to do now. I would rather enjoy playing my instrument instead of learning how to use another monolithic software to enable me to do so.
