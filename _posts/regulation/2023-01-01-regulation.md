Aspiring programmers seem to perceive programming like a playing the guitar to serenade your love at first sight, in that they think of a fun song, immediately start writing, and play it. But in reality, its a concert. You have to collaborate with other musicians, secure a venue and setting (*devops*), convince people to come (*marketing*) and tell them how to get there (*documentation*), and hold dress rehearsals (*testing*). Otherwise, you're just a bum playing your trombone in the streets with no one listening, except for the disgruntled apartment residents above you that are the source of the tomatoes.
