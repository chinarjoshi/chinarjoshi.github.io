Software ages like fine milk. To keep it from spoiling, it takes a team of dedicated people and countless man-hours, which is a luxury open-source software (OSS) often lacks. Meanwhile, Big Tech products brandish the industry's best engineers and colossal neural networks, further widening the gap due to demand for the latter. Nonetheless, we have entered a democratizing era of computing, and I will only stay Team Penguin if they take advantage of the new resources. Now that creativity is the limiting reactant to produce great software, the door is wide open for people like me. So I will bridge this automation gap by first articulating specific usability problems I encounter (in <a href="https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/wisdom-james-mickens"><i>James Mickens</i></a>-style), and second proposing simple yet cutting-edge solutions that combine underutilized OS features with generative AI models.
  </p>
  <p>
  This blog presents a series of persuasive arguments to defend those solutions, record the knowledge from my first two years of college, and expand the frontier of OSS. I'm bored of the traditional way humans use computers, but I see a clear path to making it seamless. Throughout these articles, you'll find topics from a wide breadth of disciplines that I found really cool. I've poured considerable research into each article to ensure that curiosity is the only prerequisite to comprehension. I hope reading it provides you with fresh perspective on problems, or recreates an <i>"aha!"</i> moment I had.
