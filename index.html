<div class="intro">
  <p>
  To those who think Linux enthusiasts are eccentric and their software is archaic, I couldn’t agree more. Non-profit work from disparate programmers will never match the polish of Apple products powered by the industry’s best engineers and their 10-gazillion parameter neural networks. However, the fact that Linux servers power the state of the art of AI, yet Linux users don’t see a lick of it, is possibly the worst trade deal of the Unix epoch. I want to change that incrementally by documenting specific problems I face using the Linux desktop, and solving them through modular programs and machine learning solutions. Thus, I want to bridge the gap between **Linux enthusiasts** and **AI enthusiasts**, two significant yet disparate communities.
