  To those who think Linux users are eccentric and their software is archaic, I couldn’t agree more; non-profit work from disparate programmers generally cannot match the polish of Big Tech products. They're powered by the industry’s best engineers and colossal neural networks, and this gap is only widening due to demand for the latter. The fact that Linux servers power those colossal networks and yet Linux users don't see a lick of it is possibly the worst trade deal of the Unix epoch. Nonetheless, we have entered a democratizing era of computing, and I'm only going to continue using Linux if it takes advantage of this. So I will bridge this automation gap by first articulating specific usability problems I encounter in <a href="https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/wisdom-james-mickens"><i>James Mickens</i></a>-style, and second proposing simple yet cutting-edge solutions that combine underutilized OS features with generative AI models.

  This blog is the culmination of my first two years of college, written for personal fun and academic exploration. It is a living document of my discoveries and insights across a wide breadth of computer science diciplines to give my thoughts a rhetoric home. I hope reading it provides you with fresh perspective on problems, or recreates an "aha!" moment I had. If you disagree with something I said or find a project that piques your interest, please consider <a href="mailto:chinarjoshi7@gmail.com">reaching out</a> and contributing!

  <i>Note</i>: Most of my programs require an LLM. I reccomend locally hosting an LLM server with an OpenAI-compatible API to avoid <a href=https://openai.com/pricing>paying</a>. A convenient GPU-utilizing option is <a href=https://github.com/ollama/ollama>Ollama</a>, for which my programs will use its REST API.
